# fantasy_basketball

I use ESPN API to get data from my private fantasy league. 

There is no documentation for the API, so I had to dig through different places to get information.

To get data from your private league, you need to obtain your "SWID" and "ESPN_S2". 

In this repo, I convert the player JSON data into pandas dataframe. I manually checked to see which stats correspond to which because the data is unlabeled.

Currently, I use the dataframe to see injured players, and list of unrostered players who may get more time as a result. 

More updates probably coming soon. Depends on what I need. Could convert to scripts if I find multiple utilities.
